Conclusion:

The majority of movies were launched on Friday and Wednesday and only a few movies were launched on Thursday and Tuesday while no movie was released on Monday. Between 1939 and 2015, for many studios, action was the highest-grossing movie genre during this period of time. For Buena Vista Studios, the majority of gross income comes from animation while comedy was a high grossing genre for Universal.
